SodaRack
========

Stand-alone HTML page built with AngularJS and Bootstrap.

<b>Scenario: Create a web-­‐based soda fountain inventory application</b><br />
Here at Rackspace Hosting, we drink plenty of soda! Our employees (Rackers) could use a handy web-­‐based application to track (and possibly find) their favorite soda at our various “Refueling Stations”. These stations are located in area-­‐specific named locations throughout the building. Create a web-­‐based application that allows a user to:
<ul>
  <li>Create a “Refueling Station”</li>
  <li>Create a soda flavor (e.g. Coke, Dr. Pepper, Sprite)</li>
  <li>Associate a soda-­‐flavor with a specific “Refueling Station” or stations.</li>
</ul>

<br />

<b>Notes</b><br />
Although my expertise is definitely with jQuery for DOM manipulation, I decided to use AngularJS exclusively for the entire application, since that will be what I will have to learn quickly if I'm considered for this position. I had no previous experience with AngularJS prior to creating SodaRack, so there was a great deal of learning-on-the-go. I tried to model my design of AngularJS controllers and directives to the best of my knowledge of the best practices (directives should have one job, controllers should not manipulate dom, etc.).

<b>Enjoy!</b>
